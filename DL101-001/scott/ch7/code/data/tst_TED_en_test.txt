We could use sales, anything you like.
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,
when companies are innovating,
they scale beautifully.
And we've looked at 23,000 companies
in the United States, may I say.
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.
What is astonishing about companies
is that they scale sublinearly
like biology,
indicating that they're dominated,
not by super-linear
innovation and ideas;
they become dominated
by economies of scale.
In that interpretation,
by bureaucracy and administration,
and they do it beautifully, may I say.
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,
I could have predicted the size of Walmart.
If it has this sublinear scaling,
the theory says
we should have sigmoidal growth.
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.
That's what we like, hockey sticks.
But you notice, I've cheated,
because I've only gone up to '94.
Let's go up to 2008.
That red line is from the theory.
So if I'd have done this in 1994,
I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.
And then this is repeated
across the entire spectrum of companies.
There they are. That's 23,000 companies.
They all start looking like hockey sticks,
they all bend over,
and they all die like you and me.
Thank you.

I have been teaching for a long time,

have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning
that I really wish more people would understand
about the potential of students.
In 1931, my grandmother --

graduated from the eighth grade.
She went to school to get the information
because that's where the information lived.
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;
